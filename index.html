            <p class="bio">Originally from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, I moved to Phoenix in April 2018. After nearly 20 years in the food and beverage industry, even though I love it, I am ready for a change. I will be finishing the University of Arizona Code Bootcamp in May of 2020, I want to start a career in web and app development, so I may use my creative side along with my new technical skills to make beautiful and profitable websites and apps for companies on the cutting edge of service and technology.</p>
<br>
            <p>   In my free time I enjoy playing music, I am a bassist and guitarist. I also am a sound engineer, I use both Pro Tools and I have a vintage tape studio.  I am often out watching a band at one of several Phoenix music venues, or trying a new restaurant with my amazing girlfriend, Samantha.  I also like to spend time in the great outdoors with my adopted shelter dogs, Navi and Link. 
            </p>
<br>
            <p>   I am a fan of science fiction and fantasy literature, and I like to watch movies of all types, but I lean towards independent films.</p>
